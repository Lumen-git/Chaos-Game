# The Chaos Game

This project was created early in my high school Java class. The code isn't elegant but it works. The main goal was to mess around a little bit with chaos game and learn the basics of BlueJ and Java.

To view each version of the chaos game, run the following files:

Sierpinski Triangle: Generates the Sierpinski Triangle (Tri-Force like triangle fractal)

Sierpinski Triangle Color: Same as above, but colors the points based on what vertex they approach.

Sierpinski Carpet: Generates the Sierpinski Carpet (Classic square shaped fractal, often seen in 3D)

Square Limit: Generates a square fractal by limiting what vertex can be approached. From Wikipedia "If the chaos game is run with a square, no fractal appears and the interior of the square fills evenly with points. However, if restrictions are placed on the choice of vertices, fractals will appear in the square. For example, if the current vertex cannot be chosen in the next iteration, this fractal appears..."

Square Limit 2: Another limited square. From Wikipedia "If the current vertex cannot be one place away (anti-clockwise) from the previously chosen vertex, this fractal appears..."

Vicsek fractal: Generates the square Vicsek fractal
